Ponnah…
I’m really sorry… truly, deeply, painfully sorry.

I never wanted to become the reason you feel uncomfortable —
not on a call, not in person, not ever.
You should have always felt safe with me…
but instead, my words made you feel judged.
And I hate myself for that.

You are the one person I want to protect,
not hurt.
The one person I want to lift up,
not make insecure.
The one person whose comfort means more to me
than my own feelings.

Every time I said something about your looks,
I never meant to make you feel less.
You are already enough…
more than enough.
And I should have told you that
instead of letting stupid words slip out.

Ponnah…
you deserve love that makes you feel beautiful,
respected, valued, and seen.
I promise I will learn.
I promise I will change.
I promise I will speak with care,
with love,
with gentleness.

I don’t want to lose the warmth of your voice,
the comfort of your presence,
the softness of your heart.

Please forgive me…
not because I deserve it,
but because I truly want to become a better man for you.
For us.
For the love I never want to lose. ❤️
